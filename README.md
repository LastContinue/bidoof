This is a just-for-fun app to learn some more Go(lang).

It just watches a message queue and does a few things.

I wanted it to be Pokemon themed, and I think the noble Bidoof is the closest to a gopher Pokemon there is.
Also, it does do some beaver like activities (builds dams, swims, etc) so I'm guessing it can also "chew" through the message queue ðŸ˜‰
